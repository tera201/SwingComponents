# Swing-Components

This project is based on a collection of works by **[Raven Laing](https://github.com/DJ-Raven)**. 
It combines various components from his library to create the **Swing-Components** project, 
which provides modern-style charts and spinners for Java Swing applications. 
Iâ€™ve integrated and adapted these components with some custom modifications to suit the specific needs of my idea plugin project.
## Features

- **Modern Style Charts**: A set of visually appealing and modern charts for better UI presentation.
- **Stylish Spinners**: Enhanced spinners with a modern look, improving user experience during loading states.
- **Custom Modifications**: Some minor changes have been made to adapt these components for my specific plugin requirements.
